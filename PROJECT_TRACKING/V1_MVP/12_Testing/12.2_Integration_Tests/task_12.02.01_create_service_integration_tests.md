## Detailed Description:
Create comprehensive integration test suite that validates interactions between all microservices, database operations, and external system integrations.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up integration test framework with test containers
- [ ] 2. Create user service integration tests (auth, profile, roles)
- [ ] 3. Create inventory service integration tests (products, stock, warehouses)
- [ ] 4. Create order service integration tests (order lifecycle, fulfillment)
- [ ] 5. Create payment service integration tests (payment flows, webhooks)
- [ ] 6. Create integration service tests (marketplace sync, APIs)
- [ ] 7. Test event-driven communication between services
- [ ] 8. Test database transactions and data consistency
- [ ] 9. Test external API integrations (payment gateways, marketplaces)
- [ ] 10. Set up end-to-end test scenarios across all services

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Integration test framework operational with test containers
- [ ] User service integration tests validating auth flows
- [ ] Inventory service tests covering core operations
- [ ] Order service tests validating order lifecycle
- [ ] Payment service tests confirming payment processing
- [ ] Integration service tests verifying marketplace connectivity
- [ ] Event-driven communication tested and validated
- [ ] Database transaction integrity verified
- [ ] External API integrations tested thoroughly
- [ ] End-to-end scenarios covering complete user journeys

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Use testcontainers for realistic integration testing
* Test both happy path and failure scenarios
* Validate data consistency across service boundaries
* Test event ordering and delivery guarantees
* Consider performance impact of integration tests
