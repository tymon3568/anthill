## Detailed Description:
Conduct comprehensive penetration testing and vulnerability assessment to identify security weaknesses and validate the effectiveness of security controls.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Engage qualified penetration testing service provider
- [ ] 2. Define scope and rules of engagement for pentest
- [ ] 3. Conduct black-box testing of external interfaces
- [ ] 4. Perform gray-box testing of internal systems
- [ ] 5. Test for common web application vulnerabilities
- [ ] 6. Assess authentication and authorization mechanisms
- [ ] 7. Test for injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, etc.)
- [ ] 8. Evaluate session management security
- [ ] 9. Test API security and access controls
- [ ] 10. Generate detailed penetration testing report
