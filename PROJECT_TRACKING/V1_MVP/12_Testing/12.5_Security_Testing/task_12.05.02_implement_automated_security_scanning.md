## Detailed Description:
Implement automated security scanning tools in the CI/CD pipeline to continuously monitor for vulnerabilities, security misconfigurations, and compliance issues.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up cargo-audit for Rust dependency scanning
- [ ] 2. Configure security scanning for Docker images (Trivy, Clair)
- [ ] 3. Set up container vulnerability scanning
- [ ] 4. Implement secrets detection in code (git-secrets, truffleHog)
- [ ] 5. Set up static application security testing (SAST)
- [ ] 6. Configure dynamic application security testing (DAST)
- [ ] 7. Set up infrastructure as code security scanning
- [ ] 8. Implement compliance checking (GDPR, PCI DSS)
- [ ] 9. Create security dashboards and reporting
- [ ] 10. Set up automated security patching workflows

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Cargo-audit integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Docker image vulnerability scanning operational
- [ ] Container security scanning implemented
- [ ] Secrets detection preventing credential leaks
- [ ] SAST tools identifying code vulnerabilities
- [ ] DAST tools testing runtime security
- [ ] Infrastructure security scanning active
- [ ] Compliance checking automated
- [ ] Security dashboards providing visibility
- [ ] Automated patching workflows operational

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Security scanning should not significantly slow down CI/CD
* Implement proper severity thresholds for different scan types
* Set up automated remediation for low-severity issues
* Ensure security scans run on all code changes
* Integrate security findings into development workflow
