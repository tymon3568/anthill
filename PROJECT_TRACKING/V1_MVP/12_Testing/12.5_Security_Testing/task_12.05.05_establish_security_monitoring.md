## Detailed Description:
Establish continuous security monitoring system to detect and respond to security threats, unauthorized access attempts, and suspicious activities in real-time.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up security information and event management (SIEM) system
- [ ] 2. Configure intrusion detection system (IDS) for network monitoring
- [ ] 3. Set up file integrity monitoring for critical system files
- [ ] 4. Configure log analysis for security event detection
- [ ] 5. Set up real-time alerting for security incidents
- [ ] 6. Create security incident response dashboard
- [ ] 7. Implement automated threat intelligence feeds
- [ ] 8. Set up vulnerability scanning automation
- [ ] 9. Create security metrics and KPI tracking
- [ ] 10. Establish security incident response procedures

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] SIEM system operational and collecting security events
- [ ] IDS configured and monitoring network traffic
- [ ] File integrity monitoring active for critical files
- [ ] Log analysis detecting security patterns
- [ ] Real-time security alerting functional
- [ ] Security dashboard providing visibility
- [ ] Threat intelligence feeds integrated
- [ ] Automated vulnerability scanning operational
- [ ] Security metrics and KPIs tracked
- [ ] Incident response procedures documented and tested

---
* Security monitoring is essential for production systems
* Implement proper alerting thresholds to avoid alert fatigue
* Ensure security monitoring doesn't impact system performance
* Regular review and tuning of security monitoring rules
* Integrate security monitoring with existing operations tools
