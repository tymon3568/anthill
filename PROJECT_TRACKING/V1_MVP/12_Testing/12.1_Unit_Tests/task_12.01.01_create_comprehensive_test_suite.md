## Detailed Description:
Create comprehensive unit test suite covering all business logic, domain models, and core functionality across all microservices with proper mocking and test isolation.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up testing framework for each service (tokio-test, sqlx-test)
- [ ] 2. Create unit tests for core domain logic in user service
- [ ] 3. Create unit tests for inventory business logic
- [ ] 4. Create unit tests for order processing logic
- [ ] 5. Create unit tests for payment processing logic
- [ ] 6. Create unit tests for integration adapter logic
- [ ] 7. Implement proper mocking for external dependencies
- [ ] 8. Set up test database fixtures and factories
- [ ] 9. Create test utilities and helper functions
- [ ] 10. Set up test coverage reporting and CI integration

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Unit test framework operational for all services
- [ ] Core business logic thoroughly tested
- [ ] External dependencies properly mocked
- [ ] Test isolation maintained across test runs
- [ ] Test fixtures and factories reusable
- [ ] Test utilities supporting complex scenarios
- [ ] Test coverage > 80% for core logic
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline running tests automatically
- [ ] Performance impact of tests acceptable
- [ ] Documentation updated with testing guidelines

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Focus on testing business logic in isolation from infrastructure
* Use mocks for external services and databases
* Implement both positive and negative test scenarios
* Consider property-based testing for complex business rules
* Set up test databases with known state for integration tests
