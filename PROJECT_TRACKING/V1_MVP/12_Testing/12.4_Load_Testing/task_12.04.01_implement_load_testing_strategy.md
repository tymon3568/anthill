## Detailed Description:
Implement comprehensive load testing strategy to validate system performance under various load conditions and ensure scalability requirements are met.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Choose load testing tools (k6, Artillery, Locust)
- [ ] 2. Define load testing scenarios (normal, peak, stress)
- [ ] 3. Create realistic user behavior simulation scripts
- [ ] 4. Set up distributed load testing infrastructure
- [ ] 5. Implement API endpoint load testing
- [ ] 6. Test database performance under concurrent load
- [ ] 7. Validate caching effectiveness under load
- [ ] 8. Test event-driven system performance
- [ ] 9. Set up performance monitoring during load tests
- [ ] 10. Create performance regression detection

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Load testing tools selected and configured
- [ ] Realistic load scenarios defined and implemented
- [ ] Distributed load testing infrastructure operational
- [ ] API endpoints tested under various load conditions
- [ ] Database performance validated under concurrent load
- [ ] Caching effectiveness confirmed
- [ ] Event system performance verified
- [ ] Performance monitoring integrated
- [ ] Performance regression detection implemented
- [ ] Load testing results analyzed and documented

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Focus on realistic load patterns (not just maximum throughput)
* Test both normal operation and peak load scenarios
* Monitor resource utilization during tests (CPU, memory, database)
* Set performance SLAs and validate against them
* Use load testing to identify optimization opportunities
