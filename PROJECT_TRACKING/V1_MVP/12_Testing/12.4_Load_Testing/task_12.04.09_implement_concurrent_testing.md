## Detailed Description:
Implement concurrent user testing to validate system performance under high concurrency scenarios and identify race conditions and synchronization issues.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up concurrent user simulation framework
- [ ] 2. Test database concurrent access patterns
- [ ] 3. Validate inventory stock reservation under concurrency
- [ ] 4. Test order processing with multiple simultaneous orders
- [ ] 5. Validate payment processing concurrency
- [ ] 6. Test event-driven system under high concurrency
- [ ] 7. Identify and resolve race conditions
- [ ] 8. Validate transaction isolation levels
- [ ] 9. Test system stability under sustained concurrent load
- [ ] 10. Create concurrent testing reporting and analysis

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Concurrent user simulation framework operational
- [ ] Database concurrent access patterns validated
- [ ] Inventory stock reservation concurrency tested
- [ ] Order processing concurrency validated
- [ ] Payment processing concurrency confirmed
- [ ] Event-driven system concurrency verified
- [ ] Race conditions identified and resolved
- [ ] Transaction isolation levels validated
- [ ] System stability under concurrent load confirmed
- [ ] Concurrent testing results analyzed and documented

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Concurrent testing is crucial for identifying race conditions
* Test both optimistic and pessimistic locking scenarios
* Validate database transaction isolation effectiveness
* Consider different concurrency patterns (read-heavy, write-heavy)
* Monitor resource contention during concurrent tests
