## Detailed Description:
Implement scalability testing to validate system performance as load increases and determine maximum capacity limits and scaling requirements.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Define scalability testing methodology and metrics
- [ ] 2. Test horizontal scaling effectiveness
- [ ] 3. Test vertical scaling capabilities
- [ ] 4. Validate load balancer performance and distribution
- [ ] 5. Test database scaling and replication
- [ ] 6. Validate caching scalability
- [ ] 7. Test message queue scalability
- [ ] 8. Validate auto-scaling policies and triggers
- [ ] 9. Determine system capacity limits
- [ ] 10. Create scalability testing report and recommendations

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Scalability testing methodology defined
- [ ] Horizontal scaling effectiveness validated
- [ ] Vertical scaling capabilities confirmed
- [ ] Load balancer performance verified
- [ ] Database scaling and replication tested
- [ ] Caching scalability validated
- [ ] Message queue scalability confirmed
- [ ] Auto-scaling policies tested
- [ ] System capacity limits determined
- [ ] Scalability report and recommendations delivered

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Scalability testing determines how system performs as load increases
* Test both horizontal and vertical scaling approaches
* Validate that scaling actually improves performance
* Consider cost implications of different scaling strategies
* Document scaling limits and recommendations
