## Detailed Description:
Create endurance testing framework to validate system stability, performance, and resource usage over extended periods under sustained load.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up endurance testing infrastructure
- [ ] 2. Define long-running test scenarios (24-72 hours)
- [ ] 3. Create sustained load simulation tools
- [ ] 4. Test memory usage patterns over time
- [ ] 5. Validate database performance under sustained load
- [ ] 6. Test resource leak detection and prevention
- [ ] 7. Validate system stability during extended operation
- [ ] 8. Test background job and scheduled task performance
- [ ] 9. Create endurance test monitoring and analysis
- [ ] 10. Set up automated endurance test execution

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Endurance testing infrastructure operational
- [ ] Long-running test scenarios defined
- [ ] Sustained load simulation tools functional
- [ ] Memory usage patterns validated over time
- [ ] Database performance under sustained load confirmed
- [ ] Resource leak detection and prevention working
- [ ] System stability during extended operation verified
- [ ] Background job performance validated
- [ ] Endurance test monitoring and analysis operational
- [ ] Automated endurance test execution functional

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Endurance testing validates system behavior over time
* Focus on identifying resource leaks and degradation
* Test both application and infrastructure stability
* Consider different load patterns for endurance testing
* Monitor system behavior for the entire test duration
