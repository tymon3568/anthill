## Detailed Description:
Create Black Friday simulation testing to validate system performance under extreme peak load conditions similar to major shopping events.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Analyze Black Friday traffic patterns and user behavior
- [ ] 2. Create realistic Black Friday load simulation scripts
- ] 3. Implement flash sale and limited-time offer scenarios
- [ ] 4. Test concurrent order placement and payment processing
- [ ] 5. Validate inventory stock management under high concurrency
- [ ] 6. Test system recovery after peak load periods
- [ ] 7. Validate caching and CDN performance under extreme load
- [ ] 8. Test database performance with massive concurrent queries
- [ ] 9. Validate event-driven system performance during peaks
- [ ] 10. Create comprehensive Black Friday testing report

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Black Friday traffic patterns analyzed and documented
- [ ] Realistic load simulation scripts created
- [ ] Flash sale scenarios implemented and tested
- [ ] Concurrent order processing validated
- [ ] Inventory management tested under extreme load
- [ ] System recovery mechanisms verified
- [ ] Caching and CDN performance confirmed
- [ ] Database performance validated under massive load
- [ ] Event-driven system performance verified
- [ ] Comprehensive testing report delivered

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Black Friday testing simulates extreme but realistic load conditions
* Focus on identifying system breaking points and recovery capabilities
* Test both technical infrastructure and business process resilience
* Consider seasonal variations in user behavior patterns
* Validate that system can handle load spikes gracefully
