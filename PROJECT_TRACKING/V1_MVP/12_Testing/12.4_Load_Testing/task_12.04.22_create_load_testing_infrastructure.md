## Detailed Description:
Create dedicated load testing infrastructure with proper environment isolation, resource allocation, and monitoring for accurate performance testing.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up dedicated load testing environment
- [ ] 2. Configure load generator infrastructure
- [ ] 3. Set up test data management and isolation
- [ ] 4. Configure monitoring for load testing environment
- [ ] 5. Set up result collection and storage systems
- [ ] 6. Create test environment provisioning automation
- [ ] 7. Configure network and security for load testing
- [ ] 8. Set up cleanup and teardown procedures
- [ ] 9. Create environment performance baseline
- [ ] 10. Document load testing environment usage

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Dedicated load testing environment operational
- [ ] Load generator infrastructure configured
- [ ] Test data management and isolation working
- [ ] Monitoring for load testing environment active
- [ ] Result collection and storage systems functional
- [ ] Environment provisioning automation operational
- [ ] Network and security configured properly
- [ ] Cleanup and teardown procedures documented
- [ ] Environment performance baseline established
- [ ] Load testing environment usage documented

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Load testing environment should be isolated from production
* Ensure adequate resources for realistic load simulation
* Set up proper monitoring to distinguish test impact from system issues
* Consider cloud-based load testing for massive scale testing
* Document environment costs and resource requirements
