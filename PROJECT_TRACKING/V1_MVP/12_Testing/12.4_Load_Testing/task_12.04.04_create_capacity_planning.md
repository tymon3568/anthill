## Detailed Description:
Create comprehensive capacity planning framework and scalability assessment to determine system resource requirements for various load scenarios and growth projections.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Analyze current system resource utilization
- [ ] 2. Define capacity planning metrics and KPIs
- [ ] 3. Create growth projection models
- [ ] 4. Assess database capacity requirements
- [ ] 5. Plan microservice scaling strategies
- [ ] 6. Evaluate caching capacity needs
- [ ] 7. Plan message queue capacity
- [ ] 8. Create infrastructure cost modeling
- [ ] 9. Set up capacity monitoring and alerting
- [ ] 10. Document capacity planning procedures

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Current resource utilization analyzed and documented
- [ ] Capacity planning metrics defined
- [ ] Growth projection models created
- [ ] Database capacity requirements assessed
- [ ] Microservice scaling strategies planned
- [ ] Caching capacity needs evaluated
- [ ] Message queue capacity planned
- [ ] Infrastructure cost models developed
- [ ] Capacity monitoring implemented
- [ ] Capacity planning procedures documented

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Capacity planning should consider both current and future needs
* Factor in seasonal variations and growth projections
* Consider different scaling strategies (horizontal, vertical)
* Evaluate cost implications of different capacity options
* Regular review and adjustment of capacity plans
