## Detailed Description:
Implement comprehensive failover testing and disaster recovery validation to ensure system resilience and data protection in failure scenarios.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up failover testing framework and scenarios
- [ ] 2. Test database failover and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] 3. Test microservice failover and load balancing
- [ ] 4. Validate backup and restore procedures
- [ ] 5. Test data recovery from backups
- [ ] 6. Validate system recovery time objectives (RTO)
- [ ] 7. Test recovery point objectives (RPO) compliance
- [ ] 8. Validate graceful degradation under partial failures
- [ ] 9. Test alerting and notification systems during failures
- [ ] 10. Create disaster recovery testing report

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Failover testing framework operational
- [ ] Database failover mechanisms validated
- [ ] Microservice failover tested and working
- [ ] Backup and restore procedures verified
- [ ] Data recovery from backups confirmed
- [ ] RTO (Recovery Time Objective) met
- [ ] RPO (Recovery Point Objective) validated
- [ ] Graceful degradation under failures confirmed
- [ ] Alerting systems tested during failures
- [ ] Disaster recovery report comprehensive

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Failover testing is critical for production system reliability
* Test both automatic and manual failover procedures
* Validate that failover doesn't cause data loss or corruption
* Consider different failure scenarios (single service, database, network)
* Document recovery procedures and lessons learned
