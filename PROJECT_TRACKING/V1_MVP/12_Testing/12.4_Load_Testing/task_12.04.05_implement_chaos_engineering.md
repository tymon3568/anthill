## Detailed Description:
Implement chaos engineering practices to test system resilience, identify weaknesses, and improve fault tolerance in production-like environments.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up chaos engineering framework (Chaos Mesh, Litmus)
- [ ] 2. Define chaos experiments for different failure scenarios
- [ ] 3. Implement network failure simulation
- [ ] 4. Test database connection failures
- [ ] 5. Simulate service dependency failures
- [ ] 6. Test resource exhaustion scenarios
- [ ] 7. Validate circuit breaker effectiveness
- [ ] 8. Test graceful degradation mechanisms
- [ ] 9. Set up automated chaos experiment scheduling
- [ ] 10. Create chaos experiment reporting and analysis

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Chaos engineering framework operational
- [ ] Chaos experiments defined for key scenarios
- [ ] Network failure simulation implemented
- [ ] Database failure testing validated
- [ ] Service dependency failure testing working
- [ ] Resource exhaustion testing operational
- [ ] Circuit breaker effectiveness confirmed
- [ ] Graceful degradation mechanisms verified
- [ ] Automated experiment scheduling functional
- [ ] Chaos experiment results analyzed and documented

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Chaos engineering helps identify unknown unknowns
* Start with small, controlled experiments
* Gradually increase experiment scope and impact
* Ensure proper observability during chaos experiments
* Document lessons learned and improvements made
