## Detailed Description:
Create automated performance regression testing framework to detect performance degradation early and prevent performance regressions from reaching production.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up performance regression test infrastructure
- [ ] 2. Define performance baseline and threshold metrics
- [ ] 3. Create automated performance test execution
- [ ] 4. Implement performance comparison and analysis
- [ ] 5. Set up performance regression detection algorithms
- [ ] 6. Create performance test result visualization
- [ ] 7. Set up automated performance regression alerting
- [ ] 8. Implement performance test data management
- [ ] 9. Create performance optimization recommendations
- [ ] 10. Set up continuous performance monitoring integration

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Performance regression test infrastructure operational
- [ ] Performance baseline and thresholds defined
- [ ] Automated performance test execution working
- [ ] Performance comparison and analysis functional
- [ ] Regression detection algorithms operational
- [ ] Performance test result visualization available
- [ ] Automated regression alerting implemented
- [ ] Performance test data management operational

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Performance regression testing prevents performance degradation
* Establish clear performance baselines before optimization
* Implement automated detection of performance changes
* Consider different performance scenarios and environments
* Balance between detection sensitivity and false positives
