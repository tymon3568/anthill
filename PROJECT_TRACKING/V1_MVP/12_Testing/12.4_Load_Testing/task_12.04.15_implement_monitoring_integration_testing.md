## Detailed Description:
Implement monitoring integration testing to validate that all monitoring, logging, and alerting systems work correctly under various load conditions and failure scenarios.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up monitoring integration test framework
- [ ] 2. Test metrics collection accuracy under load
- [ ] 3. Validate log aggregation and analysis
- [ ] 4. Test alerting system responsiveness
- [ ] 5. Validate monitoring data consistency
- [ ] 6. Test monitoring system performance impact
- [ ] 7. Validate distributed tracing functionality
- [ ] 8. Test monitoring failover and redundancy
- [ ] 9. Validate alert correlation and deduplication
- [ ] 10. Create monitoring system validation report

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Monitoring integration test framework operational
- [ ] Metrics collection accuracy validated under load
- [ ] Log aggregation and analysis confirmed
- [ ] Alerting system responsiveness verified
- [ ] Monitoring data consistency validated
- [ ] Monitoring system performance impact assessed
- [ ] Distributed tracing functionality confirmed
- [ ] Monitoring failover and redundancy tested
- [ ] Alert correlation and deduplication validated
- [ ] Monitoring system validation report comprehensive

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Monitoring systems must not significantly impact application performance
* Validate that monitoring data is accurate and consistent
* Test monitoring system behavior under failure conditions
* Ensure proper integration between different monitoring tools
* Consider monitoring system scalability and resource usage
