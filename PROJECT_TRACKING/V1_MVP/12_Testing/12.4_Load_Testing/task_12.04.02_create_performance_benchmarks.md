## Detailed Description:
Create comprehensive performance benchmarks and monitoring system to track system performance over time and detect performance regressions early.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Define key performance indicators (KPIs) for each service
- [ ] 2. Set up automated performance benchmarking
- [ ] 3. Create baseline performance metrics for comparison
- [ ] 4. Implement performance regression detection
- [ ] 5. Set up performance monitoring dashboards
- [ ] 6. Create performance test data and scenarios
- [ ] 7. Implement database performance benchmarking
- [ ] 8. Set up API endpoint performance tracking
- [ ] 9. Create performance reporting and analysis tools
- [ ] 10. Establish performance SLAs and monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Key performance indicators defined and tracked
- [ ] Automated performance benchmarking operational
- [ ] Baseline performance metrics established
- [ ] Performance regression detection working
- [ ] Performance monitoring dashboards accessible
- [ ] Performance test data and scenarios created
- [ ] Database performance benchmarks implemented
- [ ] API endpoint performance tracking active
- [ ] Performance reporting tools functional
- [ ] Performance SLAs established and monitored

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Establish clear performance baselines before optimization
* Monitor performance trends over time for capacity planning
* Set up alerting for performance degradation
* Consider different performance scenarios (read-heavy, write-heavy, mixed)
* Document performance requirements and test results
