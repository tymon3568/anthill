## Detailed Description:
Create automated load testing system with scheduling, execution, and result analysis to ensure continuous performance validation.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up automated load testing execution framework
- [ ] 2. Create test scheduling and orchestration system
- [ ] 3. Implement automated result collection and analysis
- [ ] 4. Set up performance baseline comparison
- [ ] 5. Create automated alerting for performance regressions
- [ ] 6. Set up test environment provisioning automation
- [ ] 7. Implement result storage and historical tracking
