## Detailed Description:
Implement comprehensive API performance testing to validate endpoint response times, throughput, and reliability under various load conditions.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up API performance testing framework
- [ ] 2. Define performance benchmarks for critical endpoints
- [ ] 3. Test authentication endpoint performance
- [ ] 4. Test inventory API performance under load
- [ ] 5. Test order management API performance
- [ ] 6. Test payment processing API performance
- [ ] 7. Validate API response times meet SLA requirements
- [ ] 8. Test API throughput and concurrent request handling
- [ ] 9. Validate error handling under high load
- [ ] 10. Create API performance monitoring and alerting

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] API performance testing framework operational
- [ ] Performance benchmarks defined for all critical endpoints
- [ ] Authentication endpoint performance validated
- [ ] Inventory API performance tested under load
- [ ] Order management API performance verified
- [ ] Payment processing API performance confirmed
- [ ] API response times meeting SLA requirements
- [ ] API throughput validated under concurrent load
- [ ] Error handling tested under high load
- [ ] API performance monitoring and alerting implemented

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* API performance is critical for user experience
* Test both individual endpoints and API workflows
* Validate performance under realistic usage patterns
* Consider different payload sizes and complexity
* Monitor API performance in production continuously
