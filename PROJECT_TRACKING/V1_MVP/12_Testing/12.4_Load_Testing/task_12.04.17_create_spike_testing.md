## Detailed Description:
Create spike testing framework to validate system behavior under sudden, extreme load increases that simulate real-world traffic spikes and flash events.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up spike testing infrastructure and tools
- [ ] 2. Create realistic spike load scenarios
- [ ] 3. Implement gradual load increase simulation
- [ ] 4. Test sudden traffic spike handling
- [ ] 5. Validate system recovery after spike events
- [ ] 6. Test database performance under spike conditions
- [ ] 7. Validate caching behavior during spikes
- [ ] 8. Test load balancer performance under spikes
- [ ] 9. Create spike event simulation tools
- [ ] 10. Set up spike testing monitoring and analysis

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Spike testing infrastructure operational
- [ ] Realistic spike scenarios implemented
- [ ] Gradual load increase simulation working
- [ ] Sudden traffic spike handling validated
- [ ] System recovery after spikes confirmed
- [ ] Database performance under spikes tested
- [ ] Caching behavior during spikes validated
- [ ] Load balancer performance under spikes verified
- [ ] Spike event simulation tools functional
- [ ] Spike testing monitoring and analysis operational

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Spike testing simulates real-world traffic patterns
* Focus on system behavior during extreme but temporary load
* Test both application and infrastructure response
* Validate that spikes don't cause cascading failures
* Consider different types of spikes (traffic, data, compute)
