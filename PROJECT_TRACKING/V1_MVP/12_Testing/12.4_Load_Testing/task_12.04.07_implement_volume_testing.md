## Detailed Description:
Implement volume testing to validate system performance and functionality with large datasets, simulating real-world data growth scenarios.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Create large dataset generation tools
- [ ] 2. Set up volume testing infrastructure
- [ ] 3. Test database performance with millions of records
- [ ] 4. Validate search and filtering with large datasets
- [ ] 5. Test reporting and analytics with big data
- [ ] 6. Validate pagination performance at scale
- [ ] 7. Test caching effectiveness with large datasets
- [ ] 8. Validate backup and recovery with large volumes
