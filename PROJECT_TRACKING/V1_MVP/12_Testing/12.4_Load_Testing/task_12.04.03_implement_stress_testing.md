## Detailed Description:
Implement stress testing to identify system breaking points, resource limitations, and failure modes under extreme load conditions.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Define stress testing scenarios (beyond normal peak load)
- [ ] 2. Set up stress testing infrastructure and tools
- [ ] 3. Test database connection pool exhaustion
- [ ] 4. Test memory usage under extreme load
- [ ] 5. Test CPU utilization limits
- [ ] 6. Identify system breaking points and failure modes
- [ ] 7. Test recovery mechanisms after failures
- [ ] 8. Validate circuit breaker patterns
- [ ] 9. Test graceful degradation under resource constraints
- [ ] 10. Document stress test findings and recommendations

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Stress testing scenarios defined and executed
- [ ] Testing infrastructure supporting extreme loads
- [ ] Database connection limits identified and tested
- [ ] Memory usage patterns understood under stress
- [ ] CPU utilization limits determined
- [ ] System breaking points identified and documented
- [ ] Recovery mechanisms validated
- [ ] Circuit breaker patterns tested
- [ ] Graceful degradation confirmed
- [ ] Stress test results documented and analyzed

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Stress testing goes beyond normal load testing to find breaking points
* Focus on identifying failure modes and recovery capabilities
* Test system behavior under resource exhaustion
* Validate that failures are graceful and recoverable
* Document findings for capacity planning
