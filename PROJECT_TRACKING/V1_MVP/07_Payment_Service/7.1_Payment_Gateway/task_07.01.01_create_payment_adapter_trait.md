## Detailed Description:
Create a unified payment gateway adapter trait that defines the common interface for all payment provider integrations (VNPay, Stripe, MoMo, ZaloPay).

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Define `PaymentAdapter` trait with core payment methods
- [ ] 2. Create `PaymentConfig` struct for gateway credentials

- [ ] 5. Implement `refund_payment()` method
- [ ] 6. Create error types for payment-specific errors
- [ ] 7. Add idempotency support for payment operations
- [ ] 8. Implement webhook signature verification
- [ ] 9. Create adapter factory for instantiation
- [ ] 10. Add comprehensive logging for payment events

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] PaymentAdapter trait properly defined and documented
- [ ] Base implementation provides common payment functionality
- [ ] Payment intent creation interface ready
- [ ] Payment confirmation interface ready
- [ ] Refund processing interface ready
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive for payment operations
- [ ] Idempotency support for duplicate prevention
- [ ] Webhook verification foundation established
