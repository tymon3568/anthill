## Detailed Description:
Setup Cube.js analytics engine for real-time business intelligence, data modeling, and API generation for inventory and business metrics.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Install and configure Cube.js in Docker container
- [ ] 2. Create database connection to PostgreSQL data source
- [ ] 3. Define data schema files for inventory metrics
- [ ] 4. Create measures: total inventory value, order counts, revenue
- [ ] 5. Define dimensions: time, product categories, warehouses, tenants
- [ ] 6. Set up Cube.js REST API endpoints
- [ ] 7. Configure Cube.js Playground for data exploration
- [ ] 8. Set up caching with Redis for performance
- [ ] 9. Create pre-aggregations for common queries
- [ ] 10. Set up monitoring and alerting for Cube.js

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Cube.js server running and accessible
- [ ] Database connection configured correctly
- [ ] Data schema defined for key business metrics
- [ ] Measures and dimensions properly configured
- [ ] REST API endpoints responding correctly
- [ ] Playground accessible for data exploration
