## Detailed Description:
Implement incremental pre-aggregation refresh strategy to update only changed data instead of rebuilding entire aggregations, improving performance and reducing system load.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Design incremental refresh detection mechanism
- [ ] 2. Implement change tracking for source data
- ] 3. Create incremental update logic for pre-aggregations
- [ ] 4. Set up automated refresh scheduling
- [ ] 5. Implement refresh conflict resolution
- [ ] 6. Create refresh performance monitoring
- [ ] 7. Set up refresh failure handling and retry logic
- [ ] 8. Implement partial refresh capabilities
- [ ] 9. Create refresh impact analysis tools
- [ ] 10. Optimize refresh frequency and timing

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Incremental refresh detection mechanism operational
- [ ] Change tracking for source data implemented
- [ ] Incremental update logic functional
- [ ] Automated refresh scheduling operational
- [ ] Conflict resolution working correctly
- [ ] Refresh performance monitoring active
- [ ] Failure handling and retry logic operational
- [ ] Partial refresh capabilities functional
- [ ] Impact analysis tools available
- [ ] Refresh frequency optimized

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Incremental refresh significantly reduces system load
* Implement proper change detection for source tables
* Consider refresh window and maintenance timing
* Monitor refresh performance and success rates
* Balance between data freshness and system performance
