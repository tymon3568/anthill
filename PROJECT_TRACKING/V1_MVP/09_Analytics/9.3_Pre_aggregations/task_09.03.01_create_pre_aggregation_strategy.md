## Detailed Description:
Create comprehensive pre-aggregation strategy for Cube.js to optimize query performance and reduce database load for common analytical queries.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Identify common analytical query patterns
- [ ] 2. Design pre-aggregation schema and structure
- [ ] 3. Create time-based pre-aggregations for trends
- [ ] 4. Build product category aggregation layers
- [ ] 5. Implement warehouse-specific aggregations
- [ ] 6. Create tenant-isolated pre-aggregation strategy
- [ ] 7. Set up automated pre-aggregation refresh schedules
- [ ] 8. Implement incremental pre-aggregation updates
- [ ] 9. Create pre-aggregation performance monitoring
- [ ] 10. Optimize pre-aggregation storage and caching

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Common query patterns identified and documented
- [ ] Pre-aggregation schema designed and implemented
- [ ] Time-based aggregations operational
- [ ] Product category aggregations working
- [ ] Warehouse-specific aggregations functional
- [ ] Tenant isolation in aggregations validated
- [ ] Automated refresh schedules operational
- [ ] Incremental updates implemented
- [ ] Performance monitoring active
- [ ] Storage and caching optimized

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Pre-aggregations significantly improve query performance
* Balance between pre-aggregation complexity and performance benefits
* Consider data freshness requirements for different metrics
* Implement proper partitioning for large pre-aggregation tables
* Monitor pre-aggregation refresh performance and impact
