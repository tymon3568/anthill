## Detailed Description:
Integrate NATS client into the `shared/events` crate to provide reliable event publishing and subscription capabilities for microservices communication.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Add `async_nats` dependency to `shared/events/Cargo.toml`
- [ ] 2. Create NATS client wrapper struct with connection management
- [ ] 3. Implement async publish method with error handling
- [ ] 4. Implement async subscribe method with proper stream handling
- [ ] 5. Add connection pooling and reconnection logic
- [ ] 6. Create event serialization/deserialization for NATS messages
- [ ] 7. Add proper error types for NATS operations
- [ ] 8. Create integration tests for publish/subscribe functionality

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] NATS client wrapper implemented with async/await support
- [ ] Connection management with automatic reconnection on failure
- [ ] Event publishing works with proper serialization
- [ ] Event subscription works with proper deserialization
- [ ] Error handling covers connection failures, serialization errors
- [ ] Integration tests verify end-to-end event flow
- [ ] Performance considerations for high-throughput scenarios

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Consider using connection pooling for multiple NATS connections
* Implement exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
* Ensure message ordering guarantees for critical events
* Add metrics/observability for event publishing performance
