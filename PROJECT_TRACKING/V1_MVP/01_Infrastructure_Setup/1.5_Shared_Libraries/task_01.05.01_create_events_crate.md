## Detailed Description:
Create `shared/events` crate to provide event definitions and NATS client wrapper for event-driven communication between microservices.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Create new `shared/events` directory structure
- [ ] 2. Initialize `shared/events/Cargo.toml` with required dependencies
- [ ] 3. Define core event types and structures (Event, EventMetadata, EventPayload)
- [ ] 4. Create NATS client wrapper with async/await support
- [ ] 5. Implement event publishing functions
- [ ] 6. Implement event subscription functions
- [ ] 7. Add proper error handling and logging
- [ ] 8. Create unit tests for event publishing/subscribing

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] `shared/events` crate compiles successfully
- [ ] Event definitions are serializable/deserializable (using serde)
- [ ] NATS client wrapper provides async publish/subscribe methods
- [ ] Proper error types defined for event operations
- [ ] Unit tests verify event publishing and subscription functionality
- [ ] Integration with existing workspace structure

## Dependencies:
- V1_MVP/01_Infrastructure_Setup/1.3_Shared_Libraries/task_01.03.01_create_shared_libraries.md (Status: Completed)

## Related Documents:
- `shared/events/Cargo.toml` (file to be created)
- `shared/events/src/lib.rs` (file to be created)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` (event-driven architecture section)

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Events crate should be infrastructure-agnostic (not tied to specific message broker)
* NATS integration can be added later when needed for production
* Consider using async_nats crate for Rust-native NATS support
* Event versioning strategy needed for backward compatibility
