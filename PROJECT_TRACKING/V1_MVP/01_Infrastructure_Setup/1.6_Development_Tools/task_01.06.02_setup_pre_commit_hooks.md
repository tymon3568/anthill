## Detailed Description:
Setup pre-commit hooks to automatically run code formatting, linting, and tests before commits are allowed, ensuring consistent code quality.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Install and configure pre-commit framework
- [ ] 2. Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file
- [ ] 3. Add cargo fmt hook for automatic formatting
- [ ] 4. Add cargo clippy hook for linting checks
- [ ] 5. Add cargo test hook for running tests (optional, for CI-like checks)
- [ ] 6. Configure hooks to run only on Rust files
- [ ] 7. Add documentation to README about pre-commit usage

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks installed and working
- [ ] `cargo fmt` runs automatically before commits
- [ ] `cargo clippy` runs and blocks commits with warnings
- [ ] Hooks only run on relevant file changes (Rust files)
- [ ] Team members can easily install hooks with single command
- [ ] Hooks don't significantly slow down commits

## Dependencies:
- V1_MVP/01_Infrastructure_Setup/1.1_Basic_Setup/task_01.01.01_initialize_git_repo.md (Status: Completed)

## Related Documents:
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (file to be created)
- `README.md` (update with pre-commit instructions)

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Pre-commit hooks should be fast to avoid disrupting developer flow
* Consider using pre-commit.ci for automatic hook updates
* Make hooks optional during development (can be bypassed if needed)
* Focus on formatting and basic linting, not heavy operations
