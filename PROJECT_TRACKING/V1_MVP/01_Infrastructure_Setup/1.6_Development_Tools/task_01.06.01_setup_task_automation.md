## Detailed Description:
Setup cargo-make for task automation to replace repetitive manual commands and improve development workflow consistency.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Install cargo-make system-wide or add to project
- [ ] 2. Create `Makefile.toml` in project root
- [ ] 3. Define common tasks: build, test, lint, format, clean
- [ ] 4. Add workspace-level tasks for multi-crate operations
- [ ] 5. Create development environment setup tasks
- [ ] 6. Add database migration tasks
- [ ] 7. Document available tasks in README

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] `cargo make` command works in project root
- [ ] Common development tasks are available: `cargo make build`, `cargo make test`
- [ ] Workspace-level tasks work across all crates
- [ ] Task definitions are well-documented and maintainable
- [ ] Integration with existing scripts and workflows

## Dependencies:
- V1_MVP/01_Infrastructure_Setup/1.1_Basic_Setup/task_01.01.01_initialize_git_repo.md (Status: Completed)

## Related Documents:
- `Makefile.toml` (file to be created)
- `README.md`
- `scripts/` directory (existing scripts)

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* cargo-make provides better cross-platform support than shell scripts
* Can integrate with existing scripts/ directory
* Consider migrating useful scripts to cargo-make tasks
* Task should be optional - project should work without cargo-make
