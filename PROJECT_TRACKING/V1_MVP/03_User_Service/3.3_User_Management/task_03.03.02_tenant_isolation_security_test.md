## Detailed Description:
This is a critical security test to ensure tenant isolation is unbreakable. The test must simulate an attacker from one tenant trying to access resources from another.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [x] 1. Create a new integration test file, e.g., `tests/security.rs`.
- [x] 2. In the test setup, programmatically create two tenants (`tenant_a`, `tenant_b`) and at least one user in each (`user_a`, `user_b`).
- [x] 3. Create a resource (e.g., a product, an order, or user `user_b` itself) that belongs to `tenant_b`.
- [x] 4. Log in as `user_a` to get a valid JWT for `tenant_a`.
- [x] 5. Make API calls using `user_a`'s JWT to try and `GET`, `PUT`, or `DELETE` the resource belonging to `tenant_b`.
- [x] 6. Assert that all responses are `403 Forbidden` or `404 Not Found`.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] An integration test file dedicated to tenant isolation is created.
- [x] The test sets up at least two separate tenants and users.
- [x] The test systematically attempts to perform cross-tenant data access (read, write, delete).
- [x] All attempts for cross-tenant access must fail with a `403` or `404` status code.
- [x] The test must be part of the main CI/CD pipeline.

## Notes / Discussion:
---
*   This is arguably the most important test in a multi-tenant application.
