## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Profile system should support both basic and extended user information
* Consider GDPR compliance for personal data handling
* Profile pictures should be stored securely with size optimization
* Implement profile verification badges for trusted users
* Consider social features like profile linking and endorsements
* **Visibility Settings:** public (all tenant users), private (owner only), team_only (application-level filtering, no team_id FK)
* **Avatar Upload:** Endpoint scaffolding complete, S3 integration pending for production
* **Profile ID:** Auto-generated via uuid_generate_v7() database default
