**Task ID:** V1_MVP/03_User_Service/3.2_Casbin_Authorization/task_03.02.09_unit_tests_for_casbin_enforcer.md
**Version:** V1_MVP
**Phase:** 03_User_Service
**Module:** 3.2_Casbin_Authorization
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Done
**Assignee:** Gemini

## Detailed Description:
Write unit tests for the Casbin enforcer logic. These tests should run in-memory or against a test database and should not require a running server.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [x] 1. Write a test for role assignments (`g` policies).
- [x] 2. Write a test for permission checks (`p` policies).
- [x] 3. Write a test to ensure a user in one tenant cannot have their permissions applied to another tenant.
- [x] 4. Write a test to verify that an admin role grants access and a non-admin role denies it.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Unit tests are created in the `shared/auth` crate.
- [x] Tests cover adding policies, checking permissions, and verifying tenant isolation.
- [x] All tests pass successfully.

## Notes / Discussion:

*   Unit tests were added to `shared/auth/src/enforcer.rs` and use an in-memory SQLite database for isolated testing.

## AI Agent Log:
