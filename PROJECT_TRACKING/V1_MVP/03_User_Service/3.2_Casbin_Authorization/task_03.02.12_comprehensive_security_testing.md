## Detailed Description:
Implement comprehensive security testing to validate multi-tenant isolation, authorization policies, and ensure no security vulnerabilities in the RBAC system.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Create security test suite for multi-tenant isolation
- [ ] 2. Test role-based access control enforcement
- [ ] 3. Test permission inheritance and role hierarchies
- [ ] 4. Test JWT token validation and claims extraction
- [ ] 5. Test admin-only endpoint protection
- [ ] 6. Test SQL injection prevention in authorization queries
- [ ] 7. Test cross-tenant data access prevention
- [ ] 8. Test session management and token refresh security
- [ ] 9. Perform security code review and penetration testing
- [ ] 10. Test rate limiting effectiveness for auth endpoints

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation 100% secure (no cross-tenant access)
- [ ] All authorization policies working correctly
- [ ] Admin endpoints properly protected
- [ ] JWT security implementation validated
- [ ] No SQL injection vulnerabilities found
- [ ] Session security thoroughly tested
- [ ] Security test coverage > 90%
- [ ] Penetration testing completed without critical findings

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Security testing is critical for multi-tenant SaaS application
* Focus on tenant isolation as primary security concern
* Test both technical and business logic security
* Include negative testing (attempting unauthorized access)
* Document all security test scenarios and results
