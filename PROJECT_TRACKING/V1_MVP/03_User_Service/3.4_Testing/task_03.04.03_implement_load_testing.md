## Detailed Description:
Implement comprehensive load testing to validate user service performance under various load conditions and ensure scalability requirements are met.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up load testing framework (k6 or artillery)
- [ ] 2. Create realistic user behavior scenarios
- [ ] 3. Implement authentication load testing
- [ ] 4. Test concurrent user sessions and token refresh
- [ ] 5. Validate database performance under load
- [ ] 6. Test API endpoint response times
- [ ] 7. Implement stress testing for breaking points
- [ ] 8. Create performance baseline and monitoring
- [ ] 9. Set up automated performance regression detection
- [ ] 10. Generate performance reports and recommendations

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Load testing framework operational
- [ ] Realistic user scenarios implemented
- [ ] Concurrent user load properly simulated
- [ ] Database performance validated under load
- [ ] API endpoints meet response time requirements
- [ ] Stress testing identifies system breaking points
- [ ] Performance baselines established
- [ ] Automated performance monitoring in place

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Focus on realistic load patterns (not just maximum throughput)
* Test both normal operation and peak load scenarios
* Monitor resource utilization during tests (CPU, memory, database)
* Set performance SLAs and validate against them
* Use load testing to identify optimization opportunities
