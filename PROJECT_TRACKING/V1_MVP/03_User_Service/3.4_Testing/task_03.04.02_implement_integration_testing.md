## Detailed Description:
Implement comprehensive integration testing that validates the entire user service stack including API endpoints, database operations, and external integrations.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up test database with Docker for integration tests
- [ ] 2. Create test data seeding and cleanup utilities
- [ ] 3. Implement API endpoint integration tests
- [ ] 4. Test database transaction and rollback scenarios
- [ ] 5. Test authentication and authorization flows end-to-end
- [ ] 6. Test error handling and edge cases
- [ ] 7. Implement performance testing for critical paths
- [ ] 8. Create test reporting and result analysis
- [ ] 9. Set up test environment isolation
- [ ] 10. Implement cross-service integration tests

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Integration test suite operational with real database
- [ ] Test database setup and teardown automated
- [ ] API endpoint tests covering all major functionality
- [ ] Authentication/authorization flows fully tested
- [ ] Error scenarios properly handled in tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established and monitored
- [ ] Test results reporting and analysis available
- [ ] Cross-service integration validated

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Integration tests require more resources but provide higher confidence
* Use separate test database to avoid affecting development data
* Implement proper test isolation and cleanup
* Consider using testcontainers for more realistic testing
* Monitor test execution time and optimize slow tests
