  **Ready for:** PR review and merge to main

* 2025-11-01 18:00: Completed CodeRabbit PR review fixes by Claude
  - **PR #17 review:** https://github.com/tymon3568/anthill/pull/17
  - **Fixed 8 bugs identified by CodeRabbit (2 CRITICAL + 6 MAJOR + 1 MINOR):**
    1. ✅ CRITICAL: JWT expiration calculation (integration_utils.rs)
       - Changed from absolute timestamp to duration (3600 seconds)
       - Claims::new_access() expects duration, not timestamp
       - Bug would cause double-time addition: now + (now + 3600)
    2. ✅ CRITICAL: PostgreSQL port inconsistency (enforcer.rs)
       - Changed from 5433 → 5432 (standard port)
       - Changed username: anthill_user → anthill (match setup scripts)
       - Aligned with all documentation and configuration
    3. ✅ MAJOR: Negative pagination validation (db_mocks.rs)
       - Added validation for limit < 0 and offset < 0
       - Returns ValidationError matching PostgreSQL behavior
       - Prevents integer wraparound to huge numbers
    4. ✅ MAJOR: Security: sudo codecov installation (coverage.sh)
       - Removed sudo installation of downloaded codecov binary
       - Switched to bash uploader (no installation needed)
       - Eliminated security risk of sudo + downloaded binaries
    5. ✅ MAJOR: Silent psql failure (setup-test-db.sh)
       - Added sqlx-cli fallback when psql not available
       - Prevents silent seed failures on macOS/slim containers
       - Detects psql presence before attempting to run
    6. ✅ MAJOR: JoinSet documentation example (INTEGRATION_TESTING.md)
       - Fixed 'static lifetime violation
       - Wrapped TestDatabase in Arc for sharing across tasks
       - Now compiles and runs correctly
    7. ✅ MINOR: Tenant slug collisions (integration_utils.rs)
       - Added UUID to slug for uniqueness guarantee
       - format!("test-{}-{}", name, tenant_id) instead of just name
       - Prevents unique constraint violations in concurrent tests
    8. ✅ MAJOR: Unsafe unwrap() chains (enforcer.rs)
       - Replaced double parent().unwrap().parent().unwrap()
       - Used safe Option::and_then() with expect() + clear error messages
       - Prevents panics in non-standard directory structures
  - **Verification:**
    * All fixes compiled successfully with cargo check --workspace
    * 6 files modified: integration_utils.rs, enforcer.rs, db_mocks.rs, coverage.sh, setup-test-db.sh, INTEGRATION_TESTING.md
    * Pre-commit hooks passed (rustfmt auto-format applied)
  - **Commit:** 1a661fa "fix(test): Address CodeRabbit PR review issues"
  - **Pushed to:** feature/task_03.04.01_unit_test_framework
  - **PR #17 status:** All critical issues fixed, ready for final review and merge
  - **Code quality:** Improved error handling, removed unwrap(), added validation
