## Detailed Description:
Create a comprehensive unit test framework for the user service with proper mocking, test utilities, and coverage reporting.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [x] 1. Set up testing dependencies (tokio-test, sqlx-test, mockall)
- [x] 2. Create test utilities and helper functions
- [x] 3. Implement database mocking for unit tests
- [ ] 4. Create test data factories and fixtures
- [ ] 5. Set up test coverage reporting with tarpaulin
- [ ] 6. Create integration test setup with test database
- [ ] 7. Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- [ ] 8. Add performance benchmarking tests
- [ ] 9. Create security-focused test scenarios
- [ ] 10. Document testing best practices and guidelines

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Unit test framework fully operational
- [ ] Test coverage > 80% for core business logic
- [ ] Mocking system working for external dependencies
- [ ] Test database setup and teardown automated
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline running tests automatically
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Security tests integrated into test suite
- [ ] Testing documentation comprehensive

## Dependencies:
- V1_MVP/03_User_Service/3.1_Core_Authentication/task_03.01.01_implement_rate_limiting.md

## Related Documents:

- `services/user_service/core/tests/test_utils.rs` (file to be created)
- `docs/testing_guide.md` (file to be created)

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Focus on testing core business logic in isolation
* Use mocks for external dependencies (database, email, etc.)
* Implement both positive and negative test scenarios
* Consider property-based testing for complex logic
* Set up test databases with known state for integration tests

  - Verified dependency: task_03.01.01_implement_rate_limiting.md (Status: Todo - not blocking as per project context)
  - Created feature branch: feature/task_03.04.01_unit_test_framework
  - Found existing test infrastructure: 7 test files in api/tests/
  - Starting work on sub-task 1: Set up testing dependencies

* 2025-10-31 09:30: Completed sub-tasks 1-2 by Claude
  - Added testing dependencies to workspace Cargo.toml: mockall, wiremock, fake, proptest, criterion, tarpaulin
  - Added dev-dependencies to user_service_core and user_service_api
  - Created test_utils.rs: UserBuilder, TenantBuilder, test data factories
  - Created mocks.rs: MockUserRepo, MockTenantRepo, MockSessionRepo with mockall
  - Created mod.rs to expose test utilities
  - Created comprehensive testing_guide.md documentation
  - Created unit_tests.rs with example auth and validation tests
  - All files compile successfully with cargo check
  - Ready to commit and continue with sub-task 3

* 2025-11-01 10:00: Completed sub-task 3 by Claude
  - Created db_mocks.rs with MockDbPool for in-memory database testing
  - Implemented tenant isolation, pagination, count operations
  - Added TestTransaction helper for transaction simulation
  - Added MockQueryResult for query execution results
  - Comprehensive test coverage for all MockDbPool functionality
  - Commit 2b0feca: feat: Implement database mocking utilities
  - Fixed code review issues from PR #16 (commit d7058e7)
  - Sub-tasks 1-3 completed successfully
  - Note: mocks.rs from sub-task 2 needs fixing (trait signatures out of sync)

* 2025-11-01 11:00: Fixed mock repository traits by Claude
  - Commit 308cadf: Synced mocks.rs with core repository traits
  - UserRepository: Updated to match list(page, page_size, role, status), added email_exists()
  - TenantRepository: Simplified to find_by_id, create, find_by_name, find_by_slug
  - SessionRepository: Updated to revoke(), revoke_all_for_user(), delete_expired()
  - All 51 tests passing (21 mod + 9 db_mocks + 6 mocks + 6 test_utils + 9 unit)
  - Mock implementations now perfectly aligned with core traits
  - Ready to proceed with remaining sub-tasks
