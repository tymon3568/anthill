## Detailed Description:
Create a comprehensive unit test framework for the user service with proper mocking, test utilities, and coverage reporting.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up testing dependencies (tokio-test, sqlx-test, mockall)
- [ ] 2. Create test utilities and helper functions
- [ ] 3. Implement database mocking for unit tests
- [ ] 4. Create test data factories and fixtures
- [ ] 5. Set up test coverage reporting with tarpaulin
- [ ] 6. Create integration test setup with test database
- [ ] 7. Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- [ ] 8. Add performance benchmarking tests
- [ ] 9. Create security-focused test scenarios
- [ ] 10. Document testing best practices and guidelines

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Unit test framework fully operational
- [ ] Test coverage > 80% for core business logic
- [ ] Mocking system working for external dependencies
- [ ] Test database setup and teardown automated
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline running tests automatically
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Security tests integrated into test suite
- [ ] Testing documentation comprehensive

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Focus on testing core business logic in isolation
* Use mocks for external dependencies (database, email, etc.)
* Implement both positive and negative test scenarios
* Consider property-based testing for complex logic
* Set up test databases with known state for integration tests
