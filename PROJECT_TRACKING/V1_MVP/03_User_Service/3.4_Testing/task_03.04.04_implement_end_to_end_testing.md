## Detailed Description:
Implement comprehensive end-to-end testing that validates complete user journeys from registration to full system usage including all integrations.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up e2e testing framework (Playwright or Cypress)
- [ ] 2. Create test scenarios for complete user registration flow
- [ ] 3. Test authentication and authorization workflows
- [ ] 4. Validate user management operations end-to-end
- [ ] 5. Test role and permission management flows
- [ ] 6. Implement multi-tenant isolation testing
- [ ] 7. Test session management and security
- [ ] 8. Create test data management and cleanup
- [ ] 9. Implement visual regression testing
- [ ] 10. Set up e2e test reporting and analysis

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] E2E testing framework operational
- [ ] Complete user journey scenarios tested
- [ ] Authentication/authorization flows validated
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation verified end-to-end
- [ ] Session security validated across scenarios
- [ ] Visual regression testing implemented
- [ ] Test reporting and analysis available
- [ ] CI/CD integration for automated e2e tests

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* E2E tests provide highest confidence but require most maintenance
* Focus on critical user journeys and business processes
* Implement proper test data isolation between test runs
* Consider using containerized test environments
* Balance between test coverage and execution time
