## Detailed Description:
Implement table partitioning for large tables like orders and stock_moves to improve query performance and maintenance efficiency when dealing with millions of records.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Identify tables that need partitioning (orders, stock_moves, order_items)
- [ ] 2. Design partitioning strategy (range partitioning by date)
- [ ] 3. Create partitioned tables with proper constraints
- [ ] 4. Create indexes on partitioned tables
- [ ] 5. Migrate existing data to partitioned structure
- [ ] 6. Update application queries to work with partitioned tables
- [ ] 7. Test partition pruning and query performance

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Orders table partitioned by month (tenant_id, created_at)
- [ ] Stock_moves table partitioned by month
- [ ] Partition pruning working correctly (EXPLAIN shows partition elimination)
- [ ] Application queries work without modification
- [ ] Data migration completed successfully
- [ ] Performance improved for date-range queries

- `docs/database-erd.dbml` (update with partitioning info)

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Partitioning strategy: Range partitioning by (tenant_id, created_at) monthly
* Benefits: Faster queries, easier maintenance, better vacuum performance
* Consider implementing when tables exceed 10M+ rows
* Monitor partition sizes and create new partitions proactively
