## Detailed Description:
Create partial indexes to optimize queries on active records only. This significantly improves performance by reducing index size and maintenance overhead.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Create partial index for active integrations (WHERE status = 'active' AND deleted_at IS NULL)
- [ ] 2. Create partial index for pending orders (WHERE status IN ('pending', 'confirmed', 'processing'))
- [ ] 3. Create partial index for available stock (WHERE quantity_available > 0)
- [ ] 4. Create partial index for active users (WHERE deleted_at IS NULL)
- [ ] 5. Create partial index for active warehouses (WHERE is_active = true)
- [ ] 6. Test partial indexes with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- [ ] 7. Document partial index strategy

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Partial indexes created for all major query patterns
- [ ] Index size significantly reduced compared to full indexes
- [ ] Query performance improved for filtered queries
- [ ] Maintenance overhead reduced (smaller indexes to update)
- [ ] EXPLAIN ANALYZE confirms partial indexes are used
- [ ] No impact on existing functionality

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Partial indexes are crucial for performance in multi-tenant applications
* Only index the data that matters (active records)
* Significantly reduces storage and maintenance costs
* Consider partial index thresholds (e.g., only if selectivity > 10%)
