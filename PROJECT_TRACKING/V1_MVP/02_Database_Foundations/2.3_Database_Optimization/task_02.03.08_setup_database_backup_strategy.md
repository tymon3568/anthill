## Detailed Description:
Implement automated database backup strategy with point-in-time recovery capabilities for disaster recovery and data protection.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Configure PostgreSQL WAL archiving for PITR
- [ ] 2. Setup automated daily base backups
- [ ] 3. Configure backup retention policies (30 days)
- [ ] 4. Create backup verification and test restore procedures
- [ ] 5. Setup monitoring and alerting for backup failures
- [ ] 6. Document disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] 7. Test complete restore from backup

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Automated backup system operational
- [ ] Base backups created daily with WAL archiving
- [ ] Point-in-time recovery capability available
- [ ] Backup verification procedures in place
- [ ] Recovery time objective (RTO) defined and tested
- [ ] Recovery point objective (RPO) documented

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Implement both logical (pg_dump) and physical (base backup) strategies
* Use Docker volumes for backup storage
* Encrypt sensitive backups
* Test restore procedures regularly
* Document RTO and RPO for business continuity planning
