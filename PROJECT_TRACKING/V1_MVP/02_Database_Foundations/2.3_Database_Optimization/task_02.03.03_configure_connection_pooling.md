## Detailed Description:
Configure optimal database connection pooling settings for PostgreSQL with SQLx to ensure proper performance and resource utilization.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Update `shared/db/src/lib.rs` with optimized pool configuration
- [ ] 2. Set max_connections based on CPU cores formula: (cores * 2) + effective_io_concurrency
- [ ] 3. Configure min_connections for keeping warm connections
- [ ] 4. Set acquire_timeout for connection acquisition
- [ ] 5. Configure idle_timeout and max_lifetime for connection health
- [ ] 6. Add connection pool metrics and monitoring
- [ ] 7. Test pool configuration under load

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Connection pool configuration optimized for production workload
- [ ] Pool size calculated based on system resources (CPU cores)
- [ ] Connection timeouts configured appropriately
- [ ] Pool settings tested and verified working
- [ ] No connection leaks or pool exhaustion issues
- [ ] Performance monitoring integrated

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Formula: max_connections = (CPU_cores * 2) + effective_io_concurrency
* Example: 4 cores â†’ 8-10 connections
* Monitor pool usage in production to adjust settings
* Consider different settings for different environments
