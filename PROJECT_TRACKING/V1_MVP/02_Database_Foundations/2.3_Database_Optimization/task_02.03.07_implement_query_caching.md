## Detailed Description:
Implement Redis-based caching for frequently accessed query results to reduce database load and improve response times for read-heavy operations.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Create `shared/cache` crate for Redis operations
- [ ] 2. Implement cache key generation strategy (tenant_id + query_hash)
- [ ] 3. Create generic cache get/set functions with TTL
- [ ] 4. Integrate caching into repository pattern
- [ ] 5. Cache inventory levels and product master data
- [ ] 6. Implement cache invalidation on data changes
- [ ] 7. Add cache hit/miss metrics

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Redis cache integrated into application architecture
- [ ] Cache keys include tenant_id for multi-tenant isolation
- [ ] Cache TTL configured appropriately for different data types
- [ ] Cache invalidation working on data mutations
- [ ] Performance improvement measurable for cached queries
- [ ] Cache metrics available for monitoring

- `shared/cache/src/lib.rs` (file to be created)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` (caching strategy section)

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Cache static or rarely-changing data (products, warehouses, UOM)
* Use different TTL for different data types (5min for inventory, 1h for products)
* Implement cache warming for critical data
* Monitor cache hit rates and adjust strategy accordingly
