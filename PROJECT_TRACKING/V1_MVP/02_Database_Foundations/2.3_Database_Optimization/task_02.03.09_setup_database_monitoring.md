## Detailed Description:
Setup comprehensive database monitoring to track performance metrics, identify bottlenecks, and alert on critical issues.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Configure pg_stat_statements for query monitoring
- [ ] 2. Setup monitoring for connection pool metrics
- [ ] 3. Create alerts for slow queries (>1s threshold)
- [ ] 4. Monitor table bloat and vacuum status
- [ ] 5. Track index usage and identify unused indexes
- [ ] 6. Setup disk space and performance monitoring
- [ ] 7. Create dashboards for database metrics visualization

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Database metrics collection operational
- [ ] Slow query alerts configured and tested
- [ ] Connection pool monitoring in place
- [ ] Table bloat monitoring working
- [ ] Performance dashboards accessible
- [ ] Alert thresholds properly configured

* Monitor key metrics: query performance, connection count, table bloat
* Set up alerting for critical issues (connection pool exhaustion, slow queries)
* Create dashboards for operational visibility
* Integrate with existing monitoring stack (if any)
