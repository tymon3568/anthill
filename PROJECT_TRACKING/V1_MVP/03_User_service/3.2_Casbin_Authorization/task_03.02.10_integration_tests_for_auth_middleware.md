## Detailed Description:
Write integration tests for the authorization middleware. These tests will require a running instance of the service or a test server to hit the actual endpoints.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [x] 1. Write a test to ensure an admin user can access admin-only endpoints.
- [x] 2. Write a test to ensure a manager user is denied access to admin-only endpoints.
- [x] 3. Write a test to ensure a basic user can only access their permitted read-only endpoints.
- [x] 4. **Crucially**, write a test to simulate a user from `tenant_a` trying to access resources belonging to `tenant_b` and assert that they receive a 403 or 404 error.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Integration tests are added to the `user_service_api` crate.
- [x] Tests cover all roles and permission levels.
- [x] A specific test for tenant isolation at the HTTP request level is implemented and passes.
- [x] All tests pass successfully.
