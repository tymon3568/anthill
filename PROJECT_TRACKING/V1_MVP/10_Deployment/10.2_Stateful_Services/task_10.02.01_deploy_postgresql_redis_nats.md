## Detailed Description:
Deploy and configure PostgreSQL, Redis, and NATS as One-Click Apps on CapRover with proper networking, persistence, and production-ready settings.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Deploy PostgreSQL One-Click App với persistent storage
- [ ] 2. Deploy Redis One-Click App với persistence và clustering
- [ ] 3. Deploy NATS One-Click App với proper configuration
- [ ] 4. Configure networking between services (Docker Swarm network)
- [ ] 5. Set up SSL/TLS encryption for database connections
- [ ] 6. Configure backup strategy for stateful data
- [ ] 7. Set up monitoring and health checks for services
- [ ] 8. Configure resource limits and scaling policies
- [ ] 9. Test service connectivity and failover capabilities
- [ ] 10. Document service URLs and connection strings

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] PostgreSQL deployed and accessible via CapRover
