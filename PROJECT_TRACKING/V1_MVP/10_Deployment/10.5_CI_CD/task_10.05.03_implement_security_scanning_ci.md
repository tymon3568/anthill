## Detailed Description:
Implement comprehensive security scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities, security misconfigurations, and compliance issues before deployment.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up container image vulnerability scanning
- [ ] 2. Configure dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] 3. Set up infrastructure as code security scanning
- [ ] 4. Configure secrets detection in code repositories
- [ ] 5. Set up static application security testing (SAST)
- [ ] 6. Configure dynamic application security testing (DAST)
- [ ] 7. Set up container security scanning
- [ ] 8. Configure compliance checking automation
- [ ] 9. Set up security scan reporting and dashboards
- [ ] 10. Implement security scan failure handling

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Container image vulnerability scanning operational
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning working
- [ ] Infrastructure security scanning implemented
- [ ] Secrets detection preventing credential leaks
- [ ] SAST tools identifying code vulnerabilities
- [ ] DAST tools testing runtime security
- [ ] Container security scanning active
- [ ] Compliance checking automated
- [ ] Security scan reporting and dashboards available
- [ ] Security scan failure handling implemented

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Security scanning should be fast enough for CI pipeline
* Implement proper severity thresholds for different scan types
* Set up automated remediation for low-severity issues
* Ensure security scans run on all code and infrastructure changes
* Integrate security findings into development workflow
