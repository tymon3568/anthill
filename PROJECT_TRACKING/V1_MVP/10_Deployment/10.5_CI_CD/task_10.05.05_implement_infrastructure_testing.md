## Detailed Description:
Implement comprehensive infrastructure as code testing and validation to ensure deployment configurations are correct, secure, and performant.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up infrastructure testing framework
- [ ] 2. Create configuration validation tests
- [ ] 3. Test Docker image security and compliance
- [ ] 4. Validate CapRover app configurations
- [ ] 5. Test networking and security group configurations
- [ ] 6. Validate database and service connections
- [ ] 7. Test backup and recovery configurations
- [ ] 8. Configure infrastructure change validation
- [ ] 9. Set up infrastructure performance testing
- [ ] 10. Create infrastructure documentation validation
