## Detailed Description:
Setup comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, building, and deployment to CapRover with proper environment management and quality gates.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Create GitHub Actions workflow for Rust services
- [ ] 2. Set up multi-stage pipeline (test, build, deploy)
- [ ] 3. Configure environment-specific deployments (dev, staging, prod)
- [ ] 4. Set up automated testing in CI pipeline
- [ ] 5. Configure Docker image building and pushing
- [ ] 6. Set up CapRover deployment integration
- [ ] 7. Implement quality gates (test coverage, security scans)
- [ ] 8. Set up notification system for deployment status
- [ ] 9. Configure secrets management for sensitive data
- [ ] 10. Create rollback procedures for failed deployments

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] GitHub Actions pipeline operational
- [ ] Multi-environment deployment working
- [ ] Automated testing integrated into pipeline
- [ ] Docker images built and deployed automatically
- [ ] CapRover integration functional
- [ ] Quality gates preventing bad deployments
- [ ] Notification system alerting on deployment status
- [ ] Secrets properly managed and secured
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested and documented
- [ ] Deployment performance and reliability metrics tracked
