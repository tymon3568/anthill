## Detailed Description:
Implement comprehensive automated testing in the CI/CD pipeline including unit tests, integration tests, security scanning, and performance testing.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up automated unit testing for all services
- [ ] 2. Configure integration testing with test database
- [ ] 3. Implement security scanning in CI pipeline
- [ ] 4. Set up performance regression testing
- [ ] 5. Configure test coverage reporting and thresholds
- [ ] 6. Set up load testing in staging environment
- [ ] 7. Implement automated API testing

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Balance between test coverage and pipeline execution time
* Implement parallel test execution for faster feedback
* Set up proper test data management and cleanup
* Consider test flakiness and implement retry mechanisms
* Monitor test performance and optimize slow tests
