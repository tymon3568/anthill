## Detailed Description:
Deploy all microservices (user-service, inventory-service, order-service, integration-service, payment-service) to CapRover production environment with proper configuration and networking.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Create CapRover app configurations for each microservice
- [ ] 2. Configure environment variables for production
- [ ] 3. Set up service discovery and networking
- [ ] 4. Configure health checks and monitoring
- [ ] 5. Set up load balancing for multiple instances
- [ ] 6. Configure SSL/TLS certificates for each service
- [ ] 7. Set up database connections and migrations
- [ ] 8. Configure external service integrations (Redis, NATS)
- [ ] 9. Set up logging and monitoring integration
- [ ] 10. Test deployment and rollback procedures

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] All microservices deployed successfully on CapRover
- [ ] Environment variables configured correctly
- [ ] Service discovery and networking operational
- [ ] Health checks and monitoring functional
- [ ] Load balancing configured and tested
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates installed and working

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Each microservice should be deployed as separate CapRover app
* Configure proper resource limits and scaling policies
* Implement blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates
* Set up proper service discovery and inter-service communication
* Consider traffic splitting for canary deployments
