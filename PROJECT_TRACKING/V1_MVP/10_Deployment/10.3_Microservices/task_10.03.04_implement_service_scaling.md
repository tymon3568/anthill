## Detailed Description:
Implement auto-scaling and load balancing for all microservices to handle varying traffic loads and ensure optimal resource utilization.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Configure horizontal pod auto-scaling for each service
- [ ] 2. Set up load balancing with NGINX or CapRover's built-in balancer
- [ ] 3. Define scaling metrics and thresholds
- [ ] 4. Configure auto-scaling policies based on CPU and memory
- [ ] 5. Set up custom metrics for application-specific scaling
- [ ] 6. Implement scaling cooldown and stabilization periods
- [ ] 7. Configure health checks for scaling decisions
- [ ] 8. Set up monitoring for scaling events
- [ ] 9. Test scaling behavior under load
- [ ] 10. Document scaling policies and procedures

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Horizontal pod auto-scaling configured for all services
- [ ] Load balancing operational with proper distribution
- [ ] Scaling metrics and thresholds defined
- [ ] Auto-scaling policies based on resource usage
- [ ] Custom metrics for application-specific scaling
- [ ] Scaling cooldown and stabilization implemented
- [ ] Health checks integrated with scaling decisions
- [ ] Scaling event monitoring operational
- [ ] Scaling behavior tested and validated
- [ ] Scaling policies and procedures documented

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Auto-scaling should balance performance and cost
* Implement proper health checks for scaling decisions
* Consider different scaling strategies for different services
* Monitor scaling performance and adjust policies
* Document scaling events and their impact
