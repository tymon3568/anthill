## Detailed Description:
Configure Docker Swarm networking and service discovery for all microservices to enable secure and reliable inter-service communication.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Configure Docker Swarm overlay network for services
- [ ] 2. Set up service discovery for inter-service communication
- [ ] 3. Configure internal DNS resolution for services
- [ ] 4. Set up load balancing for multi-instance services
- [ ] 5. Configure network security policies
- [ ] 6. Set up service mesh capabilities if needed
- [ ] 7. Configure external service access (databases, Redis, NATS)
- [ ] 8. Set up API gateway and routing rules
- [ ] 9. Configure network monitoring and observability
- [ ] 10. Test service communication and failover

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Docker Swarm overlay network configured
- [ ] Service discovery operational
- [ ] Internal DNS resolution working
- [ ] Load balancing configured and tested
- [ ] Network security policies implemented
- [ ] External service access configured
- [ ] API gateway and routing operational
- [ ] Network monitoring and observability active
- [ ] Service communication tested
- [ ] Failover mechanisms validated
