## Detailed Description:
Setup comprehensive alerting system with multiple notification channels, escalation policies, and intelligent alert management to ensure timely response to system issues.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Choose alerting platform (Prometheus Alertmanager, Grafana Alerting)
- [ ] 2. Configure notification channels (Slack, Email, SMS, PagerDuty)
- [ ] 3. Set up alerting rules for critical system metrics
- [ ] 4. Create escalation policies for different alert severities
- [ ] 5. Implement alert grouping and deduplication
- [ ] 6. Set up on-call rotation and scheduling
- [ ] 7. Create alert runbooks and response procedures
- [ ] 8. Implement alert fatigue prevention mechanisms
- [ ] 9. Set up alert analytics and reporting
- [ ] 10. Create maintenance mode and alert suppression rules

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Alerting platform operational and configured
- [ ] Multiple notification channels working
- [ ] Critical system metrics alerting properly
- [ ] Escalation policies implemented
- [ ] Alert grouping reducing noise
- [ ] On-call rotation system functional
- [ ] Runbooks and procedures documented
- [ ] Alert fatigue prevention mechanisms active
- [ ] Alert analytics providing insights
- [ ] Maintenance mode and suppression working
