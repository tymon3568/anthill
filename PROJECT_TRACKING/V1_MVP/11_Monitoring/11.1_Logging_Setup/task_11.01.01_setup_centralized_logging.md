## Detailed Description:
Setup centralized logging system to collect, aggregate, and analyze logs from all microservices for effective troubleshooting and monitoring.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Choose logging stack (ELK Stack, Loki, or similar)
- [ ] 2. Deploy logging infrastructure on CapRover
- [ ] 3. Configure structured logging in Rust services (tracing crate)
- [ ] 4. Set up log shipping from containers to central collector
- [ ] 5. Create log parsing and filtering rules
- [ ] 6. Set up log retention policies
- [ ] 7. Configure log alerting for critical events
- [ ] 8. Create log analysis dashboards
- [ ] 9. Set up distributed tracing across services
- [ ] 10. Implement log correlation for request tracing

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Centralized logging system operational
- [ ] All microservices sending structured logs
- [ ] Log aggregation and search working
- [ ] Log retention policies configured
- [ ] Critical event alerting operational
- [ ] Log analysis dashboards accessible
- [ ] Distributed tracing implemented
- [ ] Log correlation for requests working
- [ ] Performance impact on services minimal
- [ ] Documentation updated with logging procedures

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Use structured logging with proper log levels
* Implement log sampling for high-volume services
* Set up proper log rotation and archival
* Consider GDPR compliance for log data retention
* Balance between log verbosity and performance
