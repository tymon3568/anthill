- [ ] 4. Set up application metrics collection (response times, throughput)
- [ ] 5. Create business metrics dashboards (orders, inventory, revenue)
- [ ] 6. Set up alerting rules for critical metrics
- [ ] 7. Configure Grafana data sources and authentication
- [ ] 8. Create executive dashboards for business overview
- [ ] 9. Set up metrics retention and archival policies
- [ ] 10. Implement custom metrics for application-specific KPIs

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Implement proper service discovery for dynamic environments
* Set up federation for multi-environment monitoring
* Create actionable alerts to prevent alert fatigue
* Design dashboards for different user roles (dev, ops, business)
* Consider metrics cardinality and performance impact
