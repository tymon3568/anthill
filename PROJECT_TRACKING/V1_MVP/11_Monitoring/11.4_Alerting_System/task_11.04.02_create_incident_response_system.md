## Detailed Description:
Create comprehensive incident response system with documented procedures, escalation paths, and automated response capabilities for effective incident management.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Document incident response procedures and workflows
- [ ] 2. Create incident classification and severity matrix
- [ ] 3. Set up incident tracking and management system
- [ ] 4. Define escalation paths and on-call procedures
- [ ] 5. Create automated incident response capabilities
- [ ] 6. Set up incident communication and notification systems
- [ ] 7. Create post-incident review and analysis processes
- [ ] 8. Set up incident metrics and KPI tracking
- [ ] 9. Create incident response training materials
- [ ] 10. Set up incident simulation and testing
