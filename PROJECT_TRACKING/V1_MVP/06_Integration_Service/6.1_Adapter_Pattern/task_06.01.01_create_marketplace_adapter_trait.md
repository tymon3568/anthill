## Detailed Description:
Create a unified marketplace adapter trait that defines the common interface for all marketplace integrations (Shopee, Lazada, Tiki) and provides base implementation.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Define `MarketplaceAdapter` trait with core methods
- [ ] 2. Create `MarketplaceConfig` struct for credentials and settings
- [ ] 3. Implement `authenticate()` method for OAuth flows
- [ ] 4. Implement `sync_products()` method for bidirectional sync
- [ ] 5. Implement `sync_orders()` method for order retrieval
- [ ] 6. Implement `update_inventory()` method for stock updates
- [ ] 7. Create error types for marketplace-specific errors
- [ ] 8. Add rate limiting and retry logic
- [ ] 9. Implement webhook verification and processing
- [ ] 10. Create adapter factory for instantiation

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] MarketplaceAdapter trait properly defined and documented
- [ ] Base implementation provides common functionality
- [ ] Authentication methods working for OAuth flows
- [ ] Product synchronization interface ready
- [ ] Order synchronization interface ready
- [ ] Inventory update interface ready
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive and marketplace-aware
- [ ] Rate limiting and retry logic implemented
- [ ] Webhook processing foundation established
- [ ] Factory pattern for adapter creation working

## Notes / Discussion:
---
* Design trait to be extensible for future marketplaces
* Implement common patterns for authentication across platforms
* Consider webhook signature verification for security
* Rate limiting must respect each marketplace's API limits
* Error handling should distinguish between retryable and permanent failures
