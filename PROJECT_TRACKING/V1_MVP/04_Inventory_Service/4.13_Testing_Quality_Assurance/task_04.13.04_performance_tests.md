## Detailed Description:
Implement performance tests for inventory operations, including bulk import of 10,000+ products, concurrent stock moves at 100+ operations/sec, and query performance with millions of stock_moves records.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up performance testing tools (e.g., use Rust's criterion for benchmarks or k6 for load testing).
- [ ] 2. Test bulk import of 10,000+ products: measure time and memory usage.
- [ ] 3. Test concurrent stock moves: simulate 100+ operations per second.
- [ ] 4. Test query performance on large datasets (millions of stock_moves records).
- [ ] 5. Optimize based on results (e.g., add indexes, caching).

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are implemented and run.
- [ ] Bulk import completes in acceptable time (< 5 minutes for 10,000 products).
- [ ] Concurrent operations handle load without failures.
- [ ] Query times are under 1 second for typical reports.
- [ ] Results are documented and improvements tracked.
