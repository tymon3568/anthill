## Detailed Description:
Implement comprehensive unit tests for core inventory business logic, including FIFO/AVCO valuation calculations, stock reservation logic, and reorder rules triggers.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up unit testing framework for inventory service (use Rust's built-in test or a framework like tokio-test).
- [ ] 2. Write tests for FIFO/AVCO valuation calculations with various scenarios (receipts, deliveries, adjustments).
- [ ] 3. Test stock reservation logic: reserve, release, and conflict handling.
- [ ] 4. Test reorder rules triggers: check when reorder_point is reached and triggers are fired.
- [ ] 5. Ensure tests cover edge cases like zero stock, negative adjustments, and concurrent operations.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Unit tests are written and pass for all business logic functions.
- [ ] Test coverage > 70% for core modules.
- [ ] Tests run successfully in CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions are tested.

## Dependencies:
* All prior tasks in 04_Inventory_Service (e.g., task_04.06.01 for valuation, task_04.07.01 for reorder rules)
