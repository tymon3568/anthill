## Detailed Description:
Implement tests for concurrent stock updates to ensure no race conditions, using database transactions and row-level locking for scenarios like multiple orders reserving the same stock or concurrent transfers.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up test scenarios for concurrent access (using threads or async tasks in Rust).
- [ ] 2. Test multiple orders reserving the same stock simultaneously without over-reservation.
- [ ] 3. Test concurrent transfers from the same location.
- [ ] 4. Verify database transactions and row-level locking prevent data corruption.
- [ ] 5. Test idempotency and rollback on failures.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Concurrent tests pass without data inconsistencies.
- [ ] Race conditions are identified and mitigated.
- [ ] Tests run in CI/CD environment.
- [ ] Performance under load is acceptable.
