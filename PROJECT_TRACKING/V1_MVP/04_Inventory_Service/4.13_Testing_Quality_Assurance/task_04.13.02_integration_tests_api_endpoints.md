## Detailed Description:
Implement integration tests for inventory API endpoints, covering full workflows like stock receipt to storage to delivery, lot/serial tracking, and inventory adjustments.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Set up integration testing environment (test database, mocked dependencies).
- [ ] 2. Test full stock receipt workflow: POST /api/v1/inventory/receipts → validate → storage.
- [ ] 3. Test stock delivery workflow: reserve → pick → pack → ship.
- [ ] 4. Test lot/serial number tracking integration across workflows.
- [ ] 5. Test inventory adjustments and their impact on stock levels and valuation.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Integration tests cover all major API endpoints.
- [ ] Tests simulate real user workflows end-to-end.
- [ ] Tests pass in CI/CD and verify data consistency.
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases are tested.
