## Detailed Description:
Implement comprehensive stock reconciliation system with cycle counting capabilities for maintaining inventory accuracy and identifying discrepancies.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Create `stock_reconciliations` table for reconciliation sessions
- [ ] 2. Create `stock_reconciliation_items` table for item-level counts
- [ ] 3. Implement `POST /api/v1/inventory/reconciliations` - Start reconciliation
- [ ] 4. Implement `POST /api/v1/inventory/reconciliations/{id}/count` - Record counts
- [ ] 5. Implement cycle counting strategies (ABC analysis, location-based)
- [ ] 6. Create variance analysis and discrepancy reporting
- [ ] 7. Implement automatic adjustment creation for variances
- [ ] 8. Add reconciliation approval workflow
- [ ] 9. Create reconciliation reporting and analytics
- [ ] 10. Implement barcode scanning integration for counting

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Stock reconciliation process fully operational
- [ ] Cycle counting strategies implemented
- [ ] Variance analysis and reporting functional
- [ ] Automatic adjustment creation working
- [ ] Approval workflow for large variances
- [ ] Reconciliation reporting and analytics available
- [ ] Barcode scanning integration operational
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for reconciliation flows
