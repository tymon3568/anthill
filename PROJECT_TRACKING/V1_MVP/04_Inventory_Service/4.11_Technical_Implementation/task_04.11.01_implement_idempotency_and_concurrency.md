## Detailed Description:
Implement critical technical features to ensure data integrity and reliability in the Inventory Service.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. **Idempotency**: Create an Axum middleware that checks for an `X-Idempotency-Key` header and uses Redis to store it, preventing re-execution of the same `POST` request.
- [ ] 2. **Distributed Locking**: Implement a service that uses Redis (e.g., via the `redis` crate) to acquire and release locks for specific product-warehouse combinations during stock mutations.
- [ ] 3. **Database Locking**: Review all stock mutation database queries to ensure they use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` within a transaction to prevent race conditions at the database level.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] An idempotency middleware is created and applied to relevant endpoints.
- [ ] A distributed locking mechanism using Redis is implemented for critical stock operations.
- [ ] Database transactions use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` to prevent race conditions at the data layer.
- [ ] Integration tests are created to verify that duplicate requests are handled correctly and that race conditions are prevented.
