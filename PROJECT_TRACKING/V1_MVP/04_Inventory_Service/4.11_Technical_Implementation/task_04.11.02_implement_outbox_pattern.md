## Detailed Description:
Implement the Transactional Outbox pattern to ensure reliable, at-least-once delivery of events to NATS.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Create a SQL migration for the `event_outbox` table.
- [ ] 2. Modify business logic (e.g., in GRN validation, DO shipping) to write events to the `event_outbox` table within the same database transaction as the main data change.
- [ ] 3. Create a background worker (e.g., a separate thread or process) that periodically polls the `event_outbox` table for `pending` events.
- [ ] 4. The worker should attempt to publish the event to NATS. On success, it updates the event's status to `published`.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] An `event_outbox` table migration is created.
- [ ] Business logic is updated to write events to the outbox table transactionally.
- [ ] A background worker is implemented to poll the table and publish events.
- [ ] The system can recover and send events even if the message broker was temporarily down.
- [ ] Integration tests verify the reliability of event publishing.
