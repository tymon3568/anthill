## Detailed Description:
Implement the distribution network table and logic for multi-echelon inventory management, including central warehouse to regional hubs to local stores replenishment routes.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Create migration for `distribution_network` table with columns: network_id, tenant_id, name, hierarchy_level, parent_network_id, location_data (JSONB).
- [ ] 2. Define replenishment routes with rules for auto-transfer based on demand and stock levels.
- [ ] 3. Implement logic to calculate optimal transfer quantities between echelons.
- [ ] 4. Add API endpoints for managing distribution networks: POST /api/v1/inventory/distribution-networks, GET /api/v1/inventory/distribution-networks.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] `distribution_network` table is created and migrated successfully.
- [ ] Replenishment routes are defined and configurable via API.
- [ ] Auto-transfer rules trigger based on stock thresholds.
- [ ] Unit tests for distribution logic.
