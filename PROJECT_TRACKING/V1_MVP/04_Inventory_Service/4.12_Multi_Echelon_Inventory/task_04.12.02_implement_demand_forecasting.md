## Detailed Description:
Implement demand forecasting logic using simple moving average and seasonal adjustment to predict future demand and adjust reorder points dynamically.

## Specific Sub-tasks:
- [ ] 1. Create table for demand forecasts: forecast_id, tenant_id, product_id, forecast_date, predicted_demand, method (moving_average, seasonal).
- [ ] 2. Implement moving average calculation based on last 30/60/90 days of sales data.
- [ ] 3. Add seasonal adjustment logic for demand patterns.
- [ ] 4. Integrate with reorder rules to dynamically adjust reorder_point based on forecasts.
- [ ] 5. Add API endpoint: GET /api/v1/inventory/forecasts/:product_id to retrieve forecasts.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Demand forecast table is created and populated with initial data.
- [ ] Moving average and seasonal calculations are accurate.
- [ ] Reorder points are updated based on forecasts.
- [ ] API returns forecast data correctly.
- [ ] Unit tests for forecasting algorithms.
