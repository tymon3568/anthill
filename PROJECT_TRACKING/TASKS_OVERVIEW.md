1. **Email/Password Auth** (3.1.x) - ✅ Done (User Service managed JWT)
2. **Casbin Authorization** (3.2.x) - ✅ Done (Multi-tenant RBAC middleware)
3. **User Management** (3.3.x) - ✅ Done (CRUD operations with tenant isolation)
4. **Security Testing** (3.4.x) - ✅ Done (Tenant isolation validated)
5. **Core Inventory** (4.1-4.4) - ✅ Done (Product catalog, warehouse, stock operations)
6. **Quality Management** (4.8) - ✅ Done (QC integration with inventory)
7. **Order Management** (5.1) - ⏳ Todo (Basic order CRUD operations)
8. **Marketplace Integration** (6.1-6.3) - ⏳ Todo (Shopee/Lazada/Tiki adapters)

**Estimated Effort**: 30 P0 tasks × 2-3 days each = **60-90 days** *(updated for optimized Phase 4)*
