- **🟡 P1** (Production Ready): 20+ tasks - 0% complete
- **🔵 P2** (Enhancement): 35+ tasks - 0% complete

### 🎯 Critical Path for MVP

**Immediate Next Steps** (P0 tasks that block MVP):
1. **Casbin Authorization** (3.2.x) - Multi-tenant RBAC middleware
2. **User Management** (3.3.x) - Basic CRUD operations with tenant isolation
3. **Security Testing** (3.4.x) - Critical tenant isolation validation
4. **Core Inventory** (4.1-4.3) - Product catalog and stock tracking
5. **Order Management** (5.1) - Basic order CRUD operations
6. **Marketplace Integration** (6.1-6.3) - Shopee/Lazada/Tiki adapters

**Estimated Effort**: 25 P0 tasks × 2-3 days each = **50-75 days**

## 🚀 Quick Start for Contributors
