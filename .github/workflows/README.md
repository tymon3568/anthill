# GitHub Actions Workflows

## OpenAPI Export Workflow

**File**: `openapi-export.yml`

### Purpose

Automatically exports and merges OpenAPI specifications from all microservices whenever code is pushed to `services/` directory.

### Workflow Steps

1. **Export Individual Specs**: Each service builds with `--features export-spec` to generate its OpenAPI YAML
2. **Merge Specs**: All individual specs are merged into a single `api.yaml` using Redocly CLI
3. **Commit Back**: Merged spec is committed back to the repository (on master branch only)
4. **PR Comments**: On pull requests, comments with spec file sizes

### Triggers

- **Push** to `master`, `main`, or `develop` branches when `services/**` changes
- **Pull Request** when `services/**` changes

### Artifacts

- Individual service specs (retention: 1 day)
- Merged `api.yaml` (retention: 30 days)

### Usage

The workflow runs automatically. To test locally:

```bash
# Export single service
cd services/user_service
cargo build --features export-spec

# Export all services
for service in services/*/; do
  (cd "$service" && cargo build --features export-spec)
done
```

### Outputs

```
shared/openapi/
â”œâ”€â”€ user.yaml          # User service spec
â”œâ”€â”€ inventory.yaml     # Inventory service spec
â”œâ”€â”€ order.yaml         # Order service spec
â”œâ”€â”€ payment.yaml       # Payment service spec
â”œâ”€â”€ integration.yaml   # Integration service spec
â””â”€â”€ api.yaml           # ðŸ”€ Merged final spec (for frontend)
```

### Configuration

To add a new service to the workflow:

1. Create a new job in `openapi-export.yml`:
```yaml
export-myservice:
  name: Export MyService Spec
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
    - uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@v2
      with:
        workspaces: "services/myservice"
    - run: |
        cd services/myservice
        cargo build --release --features export-spec
    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: myservice-spec
        path: shared/openapi/myservice.yaml
        retention-days: 1
```

2. Add to `merge-specs` needs:
```yaml
merge-specs:
  needs:
    - export-user-service
    - export-myservice  # Add here
```

3. Update merge command to include new spec:
```bash
redocly bundle shared/openapi/user.yaml \
  shared/openapi/myservice.yaml \
  ...
```

### Troubleshooting

**Merge fails?**
- Check Redocly CLI output in workflow logs
- Verify all specs have unique `operationId` values
- Ensure specs are valid OpenAPI 3.1.0 format

**No specs generated?**
- Verify service has `export-spec` feature in Cargo.toml
- Check that export logic exists in service's main.rs
- Review build logs for compilation errors

**Commit not pushing?**
- Ensure workflow has write permissions (Settings â†’ Actions â†’ Workflow permissions)
- Check `[skip ci]` is in commit message to prevent infinite loops
- Verify branch protection rules allow bot commits
