# Agent & Contributor Instructions — Use bun as default

This repository prefers bun for local development, scripting, and package management.
These instructions document the project's preference and provide examples so agents and contributors use a consistent workflow.

Why bun?
- Fast installs and runtime
- Single-tool approach (install, run, scripts)
- Works well with Vite/Svelte projects

Guidelines (always follow when running commands in the repository):

1) Use `bun` to run npm scripts
- Run dev server:

```zsh
bun run dev
```

- Run TypeScript/Svelte checks:

```zsh
bun run check
```

- Run tests (unit / e2e):

```zsh
bun run test:unit
bun run test:e2e
```

2) Use `bun add` to install packages

```zsh
bun add valibot@latest
bun add <package>
```

3) Use `bunx` for CLI binaries when needed

```zsh
bunx playwright test
bunx vitest
```

4) When scripting or running commands from the agent, assume zsh:
- Use absolute paths when required
- Use `bun`/`bunx` instead of `npm`/`npx`/`pnpm`

5) Git and CI
- Commit messages should reference task IDs in `PROJECT_TRACKING` when relevant.
- Example commit message:

```
feat(auth): complete authentication UI [TaskID: 08.02.01]
```

6) Notes for automated agents
- Agents should not change system-level instructions, but they should follow this file when running repo commands.
- If a command would normally use `npm`/`pnpm`, prefer the bun equivalent.
- If using tools unavailable via bun, use `bunx <tool>`.

7) Troubleshooting
- If `bun run` reports "Script not found", inspect `package.json` scripts and use `bunx vite dev` or similar as fallback.

This file is informational and intended to align local contributors and automated agents to a common workflow: always use `bun` where possible.
